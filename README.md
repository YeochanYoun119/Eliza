# Eliza
[ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1967 at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum.
The Eliza class holds the user input and response formation for a system
that collects user input and responds appropriately. Eliza
uses keyword matching to respond to users in a way that displays interest
in the users and continues the conversation until instructed otherwise.

## How it works
* Once User choose therapists who they want to talk, ELIZA reads a file with that name and the Config.RESPONSE_FILE_EXTENSION.<br>
Example filename: Eliza.rsp<br>
ELIZA will response to user's input based on therapist who the user chose.
* When user says 'bye', ELIZA will end the conversation with 'Goobye' message.
* User can save the conversation in text file if they want
