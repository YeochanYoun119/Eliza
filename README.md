# Eliza
[ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1967 at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum.
The Eliza class holds the user input and response formation for a system
that collects user input and responds appropriately. Eliza
uses keyword matching to respond to users in a way that displays interest
in the users and continues the conversation until instructed otherwise.
